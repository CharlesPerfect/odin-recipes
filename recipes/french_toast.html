    <h3>What is French Toast ?</h3>
    <p>French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan-fried. <br> Alternative names and variants include eggy bread, Bombay toast, gypsy toast, and poor knights. <br> <br>
        Oddly enough, French toast did not originate in France.<br> In fact, French toast's origins trace back all the way to ancient Rome! <br> A Roman cookbook called Apicius, dating from at least as far back as the 5th century C.E., describes a recipe for bread soaked in milk and beaten eggs then fried and served with honey.</p>
