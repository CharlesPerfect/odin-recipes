    <h3>What are Scones ?</h3>
    <p>A scone is a traditional British baked good, popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland. <br> It is usually made of either wheat flour or oatmeal. <br> <br> Scones are traditionally Irish, Scottish, and English foods. However, nobody knows which of these countries invented the baked food. <br> As far as history can trace back, Scones probably originate from Scotland. <br> Yes, the first print reference dates back to 1513 and is from a Scottish poet.</p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients :</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 gr of white flour</li>
        <li>50 gr of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>80 gr of caster sugar</li>
        <li>5 tsp of baking powder</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>250 ml of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Steps :</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C fan or 220°C</li>
        <li>Put flour in a bowl and add butter. Mix butter with flour making <br> sure to eliminate lumps by rubbing it through your fingers (infuse the butter in the flour)</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and the baking powder and give a mix</li>
        <li>Add two eggs and gently mix in</li>
        <li>Add milk and mix. The mixture musn't be to dry or to wet, <br>must be a paste (add milk depending on the mixture)</li>
        <li>Scatter flour on your workbench and fold the mixture</li>
        <li>Flatten the mixture down and roll it down, creating a circle to a depth <br> of about 2.5cm</li>
        <li>Get your scone cutter, add a bit of flour to help release the mix</li>
        <li>Every time you cut the dough relax it back so all the scones stay the same size</li>
        <li>Crack the last egg in a bowl and whisk. Then add with a brush the egg to the top of the scone</li>
        <li>Put the scones in the oven for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes take out and dish with a side of strawberry jam and clotted cream</li>
    </ol>
