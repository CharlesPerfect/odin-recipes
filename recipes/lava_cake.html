    <h3>What is a Lava Cake ?</h3>
    <p>Molten chocolate cake is a French dessert that consists of a chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate core. <br> It is named for that molten center, and it is also known as mi-cuit au chocolat, chocolat coulant, chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. <br> <br> 
        The history of chocolate lava cakes is a bit of a mystery. <br> Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten claims to have invented it at his restaurant in New York City in the 1980s. <br> However, fellow New York-based French chef Jacques Torres argues that this dish already existed in France.</p>
